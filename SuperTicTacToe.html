        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rules are very similar to a standard game of Tic Tac Toe with the exceptions listed below</li>
            <li>The game is played on a 3 x 3 grid of 3 x 3 Tic Tac Toe boards(9 x 9 in total)</li>
            <li>The first player gets to place their mark anywhere on the board.</li>
            <li>The following player must play in the smaller game aligned with the space the previous player marked
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Player 1 marks the top left square of the center board so Player 2 must place their mark in the top left <b>GAME</b></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Repeat step 4 until one of the smaller games has a winner</li>
            <li>The winner of the smaller game claims that section of the larger board
                <ul>
                    <li>If a player is forced to play on a board that has already been claimed they can place a mark anywhere like in step 3</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The game is over when a player has three marks in a row in the larger game board</li>
